# What can be done
- The Program is able able to parser the required data and then upload it into a Mongo database with their respective Structure.
- It was Programmed using Java11
- Starting the Program will start up a menu that has 4 options:
1. Read/Import the necessary data. This muss not be run because is going to crash. I hardcoded the path so that I could Upload everything easier
2. Connect to the Database
3. Upload the date to the Database
   - Before running this be sure to flush the entire Database otherwise is going to generate problems
   - Also to give the corresponding paths to parser the date before uploading it.
4. Close the program and connection.

### Notes
- Is not necessary to upload the data because I uploaded everything before hand.
- Sorry, I did not have time again to do the rest. I've been sick for the last couple days which didnt allow me to work more on the code.
